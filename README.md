In 2013 I went to school to better my chances of getting a good job. That was a very time was more educational than I could imagine.
Not only did I gain some valuable skills. Actually just going,and attending the classes and Paying attention to what I was taught gave me the credentials to further myself in the short term. But, being in that environment with many other students, some of whom were very bright., sparked an interest in computer technology. Something I could use my entire life , and through the vast knowledge pool known as the world wide  web, gain even more abilities than I did for that short time  so long ago.
